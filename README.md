# 🎙️ AI Cursor Voice Agent

> A Production-Ready, Stateful AI Voice Agent built using Modern LLM & Agent Architecture.

An intelligent voice-driven AI system that converts speech into actionable commands using LLMs, structured agent workflows, and scalable backend architecture.

Designed to demonstrate real-world implementation of:
- Autonomous AI Agents
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) patterns
- Microservices Architecture
- Stateful Memory Handling

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional voice assistants lack:
- Context awareness
- Stateful reasoning
- Action orchestration
- Production-grade backend design

This project solves that by implementing a **stateful, modular AI Voice Agent** capable of understanding, reasoning, and executing structured actions.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

Voice Input → Speech-to-Text → LLM Processing → Agent Decision Layer → Action Execution → Response Output

The system is designed with clear separation of:
- AI Logic Layer
- Agent Orchestration Layer
- API Layer
- Persistence Layer

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph (Stateful AI Agents)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI / Gemini
- **Memory & Persistence**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Async Processing**: Python AsyncIO

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Stateful AI Agent with memory persistence
- Modular microservice-based architecture
- REST API based design
- Scalable backend structure
- LLM-driven intent understanding
- Production-ready code structure
